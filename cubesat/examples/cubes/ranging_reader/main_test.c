/***************************
 * DEMO:
 * this file is intended to provide an example of how to use the ranging APIs.
 * In order to start the system, run the ranging_test executable in the
 * aloha_proto directory by passing the device file of module serial port
 * (i.e. ./ranging_test /dev/ttyACM0)
 *
 * In this way three files are created inside the shmfs: 
 * telemetry_const, telemetry_shm, sem.telemetrysem
 *
 * These files represents a POSIX IPC channel and the relative semaphore. However
 * the API provided here should garant that you doesn't need to read directly
 * the files.
 *
 * IPC files are created only by the ranging_api process.
 * Moreover these files are created in exclusive mode, so
 * no ranging process can begin if the files exists.
 *
 * Please check and delete them if they already exists before starting the
 * ranging executable.
